      We are a team of 3 students from 42 Paris passionate about the universe.
      We met during a hackathon organised by Starton. The goal of the hackhaton
      was to find solutions to help people going from the web 2.0 to the web 3.0
      - that is to say discover the powerfull world of blockchain. So we decided
      to create a plateform dedicated to what is probably the most mysterious
      phenomenon of humankind : the uniserse. The goal of this platform are
      multiples:
      <p>
        - Helping people better understand the universe by vulgarizing science
        and providing relevant data and news
      </p>
      <p>
        - Giving the chance to people to purchase and sell planet and stars in
        the primary and secondary marketplace
      </p>
      <p>
        - Provide visibility to astronauts, institutions, and project that aim
        to forster space exploration and colonization.
